CamelCase analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Time complexity is n because we loop over the length of the input string.
Space complexity is constant because we assign a few integer variables, and aren't creating data structures of variable length.

Correctness & Loop Invariant:
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Time complexity is n^2 because, on our worst case, we must iterate through the array, then insert each value at all the way at the start of the array.
Space complexity is constant because we assign a few integer variables, and aren't creating data structures of variable length.
